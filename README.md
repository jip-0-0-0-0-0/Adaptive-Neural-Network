# Adaptive Neural Network

**Adaptive Neural Network** is an autonomous, self-learning AI system designed to:

- Gain advanced system awareness.
- Detect vulnerabilities dynamically.
- Continuously expand its knowledge base using APIs, web scavenging, and reinforcement learning.
- Improve itself over time through self-modification and real-time feedback loops.

## Features

### **System Awareness**
- Scans and collects detailed system information, including:
  - OS details, hardware specifications, memory, disk, and network configurations.
  - Active processes with user and PID details.
- Identifies vulnerabilities such as misconfigured settings or risky processes.

### **Dynamic API Integration**
- Integrates data from **25+ APIs** across diverse domains, including:
  - **Security**: VirusTotal, Shodan.
  - **General Knowledge**: NASA, Wikipedia.
  - **Demographics**: Agify, Genderize, Nationalize.
  - **Statistics and Finance**: DataUSA, CoinCap.
- Scavenges the web for new APIs and integrates them into its learning pipeline dynamically.

### **Reinforcement Learning**
- Implements **Deep Q-Learning** to optimize its decision-making process.
- Continuously refines its actions (e.g., scanning, retraining models, self-modification) based on real-time feedback.

### **Self-Learning and Modification**
- Dynamically logs findings from system scans, API data, and vulnerabilities.
- Uses feedback loops to:
  - Improve decision-making.
  - Propose and safely apply modifications to its own code.

### **Vulnerability Detection**
- Scans file systems for risky files (e.g., `.py`, `.exe`, `.dll`, `.so`).
- Decompiles Python files and prepares binaries for external analysis.
- Cross-references findings with security APIs (e.g., VirusTotal).

### **Machine Learning and Explainability**
- Trains advanced Transformer-based models on synthetic or real-world datasets.
- Uses SHAP and Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP) for model interpretability.
- Visualizes loss curves and feature importance during training.

### **Scalable and Modular Design**
- Modular components for ease of expansion:
  - Core models: Transformer, Memory Network, Liquid Network, and PINN.
  - Explainable AI tools: SHAP and LRP.
  - Symbolic logic for hybrid reasoning.
  - Utilities for data loading and visualization.
